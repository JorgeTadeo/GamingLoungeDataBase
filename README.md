## Features

A register/login system used for new users to create accounts and existing users to sign into their own accounts. A query is made to the database using php to create a new user when registering. If a user is signing in then the username and password is checked if it exists in the database for verification.

## Database Design

Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagram was used to initially design the database. Many customers are allowed to checkout one boardgame, console, or PC and booth at one time. Many customers are allowed to order items and each order contains many items.

The EER diagram was then converted to a relational diagram.
